        "description": "With performance-focused features such as a hybrid neck profile and an innovative truss rod adjustment wheel, the American Elite Stratocaster continues to be one of the best modern Strats for the money. Its maple neck has a modern 'C' shape at the nut, morphing into a modern 'D' profile at the neck heel for faster lead playing and comfortable chording. And speaking of the heel, Fender's asymmetrical neck volute provides superior access to higher frets. The expanded S-1 pickup switching system will give even veteran Strat players a reason to upgrade. Fender's tremolo system is also better than ever for the American Elite, with a smoother response and a copper-infused bridge plate to help fight tuning slippage",
